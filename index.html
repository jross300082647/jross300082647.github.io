        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Justice. I am 28 years old, am a part-time student in the Software Development program, and this is my 3rd year at FVTC. I spend a lot of my time looking at art and listening to music. I love watching movies and anime with my friends, as well as playing video games. I want to start photography as a hobby, as well as maybe trying to make art myself considering that I enjoy it so much. Sol, Mars, and Earth are my three cats and I have a dog named Chimmy.</p>
